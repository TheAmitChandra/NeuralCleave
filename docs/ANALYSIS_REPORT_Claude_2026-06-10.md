# neuralcleave v2 — Deep Analysis Report

**Author:** Claude (Opus 4.8), acting as engineering analyst
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Scope:** Full codebase review of `NeuralCleave/` (54 modules, ~9,200 LOC) and `tests/` (33 suites, 502 tests)
**Verdict:** Strong component library, **weak integration spine.** The pieces are excellent; they are not yet plugged into each other.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Across Phases 0–7, neuralcleave has accumulated a genuinely impressive set of building blocks: a 3-tier memory pipeline, a task-aware model router with five providers, 14 channel adapters, a voice layer (STT/TTS/wake word), a reflection engine, a Prometheus-style metrics registry, a REST API, and a cognitive pipeline. Test coverage is high where it exists (502 passing tests).

However, the deep review surfaced a single dominant theme:

> **Several Phase 5–7 components are "islands" — fully built and unit-tested in isolation, but never wired into the running gateway.** A user connecting today would find the WebSocket returns only an acknowledgement, the REST API returns `503` for channels/memory, and every metric reads zero.

The highest-value next work is **not another feature** — it is **integration**. Phase 8 should connect the islands and prove the end-to-end path with tests.

## 2. What Is Solid

| Area | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Model router** (`models/router.py`) | Task-aware routing, auto-complexity detection, privacy mode, per-channel overrides, 5 providers, clean fallback chain. 39 tests. Excellent. |
| **Memory** (`memory/*`) | 3-tier (Redis/Qdrant/SQLite), dedup, importance scoring, compaction. 65 tests. Excellent. |
| **Commands** (`commands/handler.py`) | Clean cross-channel slash dispatcher. 24 tests. |
| **Channel base + stretch channels** | `base.py`, Teams, Mattermost, IRC, webhook well-tested. |
| **Observability metrics** (`observability/metrics.py`) | Counter/Gauge/Histogram + Prometheus export. 30 tests. Well-designed. |
| **Voice** (`voice/stt.py`, `tts.py`) | STT model caching + streaming; TTS 3-tier fallback. 26 tests. |
| **Config & wizard** | TOML + pydantic, guided `cortex init`. 28 tests. |

## 3. Integration Gaps (Functional, Not Just Tests)

These are **bugs of omission** — code that exists but is never reached at runtime.

### 3.1 🔴 CRITICAL — WebSocket is not wired to the agent
`gateway/websocket.py:139` — the `message` handler is a placeholder:
```python
elif msg_type == "message":
    # Placeholder — Phase 1 wires this to AgentRuntime
    await session.send({"type": "ack", ...})
```
**Impact:** The Next.js web UI (the headline differentiator vs OpenClaw) cannot get an AI response over WebSocket. The entire web chat path is dead.

### 3.2 🔴 CRITICAL — `set_runtime()` is never called
`gateway/routes.py` defines `set_runtime(runtime)` and every channel/memory route does `if _runtime is None: raise HTTPException(503)`. Nothing in `gateway/main.py`'s `lifespan` constructs an `AgentRuntime` or calls `set_runtime()`.
**Impact:** `/api/v1/channels`, `/api/v1/channels/{id}/send`, `/api/v1/memory/*` all return `503` in production. The Phase 7 REST API is unreachable except `/status` and `/metrics`.

### 3.3 🟠 HIGH — REST routes read attributes the runtime doesn't have
`routes.py` reads `_runtime._long_term`, but `AgentRuntime` exposes no `_long_term` — long-term memory lives at `_pipeline._memory`. Even once `set_runtime()` is wired, memory routes will still `503`.
**Impact:** Memory explorer (another headline UI feature) cannot be backed.

### 3.4 🟠 HIGH — Metrics are never incremented
`REGISTRY` is exported and scrapeable at `/api/v1/metrics`, but **no source module** outside tests calls `.inc()`, `.set()`, or `.observe()`. `AgentRuntime` keeps its own private `RuntimeMetrics` counters instead.
**Impact:** Prometheus/Grafana dashboards would show flat-zero. Instrumentation is decorative.

### 3.5 🟡 MEDIUM — Reflection engine is never invoked
`pipeline.py`'s docstring advertises "Stage 5: Reflection — quality-score," and `PipelineResult.quality_score` exists, but `run()` never calls `ReflectionEngine`. `quality_score` is always `None`.
**Impact:** The "beats OpenClaw on hallucination" claim is unbacked at runtime.

### 3.6 🟡 MEDIUM — Standalone DeepSeek provider is dead code
`models/deepseek.py` (Phase 7) duplicates the router's inline `_deepseek()`; the router never imports it.
**Impact:** Low — but it's a maintenance trap (two implementations to keep in sync).

## 4. Test Coverage Gaps

| Module | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/pipeline.py` | 176 | 🔴 **Zero tests** — this is the core intelligence loop |
| `gateway/websocket.py` | 150 | 🔴 No tests |
| `channels/nextcloud.py` | 297 | 🟠 Built in Phase 6, **test was forgotten** |
| `channels/telegram.py` | 143 | 🟠 No tests (Priority-1 channel) |
| `channels/discord_.py` | 145 | 🟠 No tests (Priority-1 channel) |
| `channels/slack.py` | 214 | 🟠 No tests |
| `channels/email_.py` | 257 | 🟠 No tests |
| `channels/whatsapp.py`, `matrix.py`, `signal_.py`, `mastodon_.py` | ~870 | 🟡 No tests |
| `voice/wake_word.py` | 207 | 🟡 No tests |
| `cli.py` | 387 | 🟡 No tests |

Real source-to-test coverage is **~70% of modules**, concentrated away from the integration core.

## 5. Recommended Next Phase — "Phase 8: Integration & Wiring"

Ordered by value. Each item = one file = one commit (per the project's one-file-one-commit rule).

1. **Wire `AgentRuntime` into the gateway lifespan** — construct it in `main.py`, call `set_runtime()`, expose `long_term` on the runtime so REST memory routes work.
2. **Wire the WebSocket `message` handler to `AgentRuntime`** — turn the placeholder into a real dispatch that returns AI responses to web clients.
3. **Wire `REGISTRY` metrics into the pipeline/runtime** — increment `messages_total`, `generation_latency_ms`, `messages_errors_total`, `active_sessions` at the real call sites.
4. **Invoke the reflection engine in the pipeline** (async, non-blocking) and populate `quality_score`.
5. **Backfill the core tests:** `test_agent_pipeline.py`, `test_gateway_websocket.py`, `test_channels_nextcloud.py`.

This converts neuralcleave from "a box of excellent parts" into "a working assistant," and proves it with tests — far higher leverage than adding a 15th channel.

## 6. Closing Note

The engineering quality of the individual components is high and consistent — naming, docstrings, error handling, and test style are uniform across 9k lines. The gap is purely architectural glue. Phase 8 as scoped above is small (5 focused changes) but turns the demo on.
